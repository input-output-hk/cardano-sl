        description = "\"Network.Transport\" is a Network Abstraction Layer which provides\nthe following high-level concepts:\n\n* Nodes in the network are represented by 'EndPoint's. These are\nheavyweight stateful objects.\n\n* Each 'EndPoint' has an 'EndPointAddress'.\n\n* Connections can be established from one 'EndPoint' to another\nusing the 'EndPointAddress' of the remote end.\n\n* The 'EndPointAddress' can be serialised and sent over the\nnetwork, where as 'EndPoint's and connections cannot.\n\n* Connections between 'EndPoint's are unidirectional and lightweight.\n\n* Outgoing messages are sent via a 'Connection' object that\nrepresents the sending end of the connection.\n\n* Incoming messages for /all/ of the incoming connections on\nan 'EndPoint' are collected via a shared receive queue.\n\n* In addition to incoming messages, 'EndPoint's are notified of\nother 'Event's such as new connections or broken connections.\n\nThis design was heavily influenced by the design of the Common\nCommunication Interface\n(<http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/common-communication-interface>).\nImportant design goals are:\n\n* Connections should be lightweight: it should be no problem to\ncreate thousands of connections between endpoints.\n\n* Error handling is explicit: every function declares as part of\nits type which errors it can return (no exceptions are thrown)\n\n* Error handling is \"abstract\": errors that originate from\nimplementation specific problems (such as \"no more sockets\" in\nthe TCP implementation) get mapped to generic errors\n(\"insufficient resources\") at the Transport level.\n\nThis package provides the generic interface only; you will\nprobably also want to install at least one transport\nimplementation (network-transport-*).";
