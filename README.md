This repository
---------------

This repository contains a Haskell implementation of the _Provably Secure
Proof-of-Stake_ white paper[1], done in conjunction with members of
[IOHK](https://iohk.io), the University of Edinburgh, the University of
Athens, and the University of Connecticut.

In the paper that lends its name to this projectÂ¹, a "Proof-of-Stake" protocol
with rigorous security guarantees is described in detail, one upon which a
full-fledged cryptocurrency can be based.

This repository is the first implementation of a cryptocurrency that uses the
provably secure distributed consensus "proof-of-stake" model proposed in the
aforementioned paper.

The paper was as closely followed as possible by the implementation's authors.

Introduction
------------

This repository hosts the prototype implementation of "A Provably Secure
Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol", the latest version of which can be found
in the [IOHK website](https://iohk.io/research/papers/a-provably-secure-proof-of-stake-blockchain-protocol/).

### Where to start

It is recommended to start by reading the documentation, which is available [here](https://cardano-docs.iohk.io/introduction/).
Its repository is [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-docs.iohk.io).
Developers are encouraged to contribute.

Platform support
----------------

At the moment, supported platforms are Windows, macOS and Linux. There are [installers
for Windows and macOS](https://daedaluswallet.io/#download), which include a node and
a [wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/daedalus).

Build from source
-----------------

To build from source, please refer to [this](https://cardano-docs.iohk.io/for-contributors/building-from-source/#cardano-sl-and-daedalus-bridge)
 page of the documentation.

Note that the [`stack` system](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) is
required before `cardano-sl` can be built.

For developer convenience, also note that in the `scripts` and `util-scripts` folders
there are a variety of utility scripts to build various components of the system,
such as the general `util-scripts/build.sh`, or the `util-scripts/clean.sh` to remove
byproducts of compilation.

Running the nodes
-----------------

If you wish to launch and run nodes locally please refer to [this](https://cardano-docs.iohk.io/for-contributors/building-from-source/#cardano-node)
page of the documentation.

Generating the wallet documentation
-----------------------------------

Build the project and run `stack exec --nix -- cardano-wallet-web-docs`. Look at the generated:
- `./docs/wallet-web-api.md`
- `./docs/wallet-table-web-api.md`
