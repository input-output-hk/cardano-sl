This repository
---------------

This repository contains a Haskell implementation of the _Provably Secure
Proof-of-Stake_ white paper[1], done in conjunction with members of
[IOHK](https://iohk.io), the University of Edinburgh, the University of
Athens, and the University of Connecticut.

In the paper that lends its name to this projectÂ¹, a "Proof-of-Stake" protocol
with rigorous security guarantees is described in detail, one upon which a
full-fledged cryptocurrency can be based.

This repository is the first implementation of a cryptocurrency that uses the
provably secure distributed consensus "proof-of-stake" model proposed in the
aforementioned paper.

The paper was as closely followed as possible by the implementation's authors.

Introduction
------------

This repository hosts the prototype implementation of "A Provably Secure
Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol", the latest version of which can be found
in the [IOHK website](https://iohk.io/research/papers/a-provably-secure-proof-of-stake-blockchain-protocol/).

### Where to start

Aside from reading the paper[1], a good starting point is the source code
hosted herein. We recommend starting with the following source files:

- [Node entry point](src/node/Main.hs)
- [Core node logic](src/Pos/Launcher.hs), and the exported modules.
- [Listeners](src/Pos/Communication/)
- [Workers](src/Pos/Worker/)

Platform support
----------------

At the moment, supported platforms are Windows, macOS and Linux. There are [installers
for Windows and macOS](https://daedaluswallet.io/#download), which include a node and
a [wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/daedalus).

Build from source
-----------------

To build from source, clone this repository, navigate to the directory
into which the project was cloned and run `stack build`.

The [`stack` system](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) is
required before `cardano-sl` can be built.

Running the nodes
-----------------

After the project is built, run it:

- open *new terminal window*, run `tmux` in it (`sudo apt-get install tmux` or else according to your distro)
- open *new terminal window*, run `export WALLET_TEST=1; ./scripts/launch.sh` in it

After a while, the first terminal windows should be populated with 4 tabs, 3 out of which will have a node running in them.

Generating the wallet documentation
-----------------------------------

Build the project and run `stack exec --nix -- cardano-wallet-web-docs`. Look at the generated:
- `./docs/wallet-web-api.md`
- `./docs/wallet-table-web-api.md`
