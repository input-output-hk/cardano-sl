-- | Check whether data from block must be fully known to our application.
--
-- We verify that data in blocks is known if protocol version used
-- by this software is greater than or equal to the adopted
-- version. That's because in this case:
-- 1. Authors of this software are aware of adopted version.
-- 2. Each issued block must be formed with respect to adopted version.
--
-- Comparison is quite tricky here. Table below demonstrates it.
--
--   Our | Adopted | Check?
-- ————————————————————————
-- 1.2.3 |  1.2.3  | Yes
-- 1.2.3 |  1.2.4  | No
-- 1.2.3 |  1.2.2  | No
-- 1.2.3 |  1.3.2  | No
-- 1.2.3 |  1.1.1  | Yes
-- 2.2.8 |  1.9.9  | Yes
--
-- If `(major, minor)` of our version is greater than of adopted
-- one, then check is certainly done. If it's equal, then check is
-- done only if `alt` component is the same as adopted one. In
-- other cases (i. e. when our `(major, minor)` is less than from
-- adopted version) check is not done.
