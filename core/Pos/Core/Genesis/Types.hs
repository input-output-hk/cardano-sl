-- Exponential stakes have the form @map (*b) [2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ...]@,
-- where @b@ is the last argument of @ExponentialStakes@. It means
-- that when distribution stakes are created, @b@ is their common
-- divisor, so weights are @[2^0, 2^1, ..]@. We also require that no
-- genesis balance is lower than sum of weights. So if stakes list has
-- length @k@ we have weights sum @2^{k+1}-1@. That's why the lowest
-- coin is taken to be @2^{k+1}@.
