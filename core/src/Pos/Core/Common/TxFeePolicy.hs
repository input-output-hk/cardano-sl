-- | Transaction fee policy represents a formula to compute the minimal allowed
-- fee for a transaction. Transactions with lesser fees won't be accepted. The
-- minimal fee may depend on the properties of a transaction (for example, its
-- size in bytes), so the policy can't be represented simply as a number.
--
-- Recall that a transaction fee is the difference between the sum of its
-- inputs and the sum of its outputs. The transaction is accepted when
-- @minimal_fee(tx) <= fee(tx)@, where @minimal_fee@ is the function defined
-- by the policy.
--
-- The policy can change during the lifetime of the blockchain (using the
-- update mechanism). At the moment we have just one policy type (a linear
-- equation on the transaction size), but in the future other policies may
-- be added. To make this future-proof, we also have an "unknown" policy used
-- by older node versions (the ones that haven't updated yet).
