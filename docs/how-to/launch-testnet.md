# How to launch a testnet

This document explains how the Cardano SL public testnet was launched
and the configuration settings used.

 * [`configuration.md`](../configuration.md)

## Genesis Data

A new genesis block is created for the testnet. The parameters used to
generate genesis data are specified in the `testnet_launch` section of
[`lib/configuration.yaml`](../../lib/configuration.yaml).

All values are inherited from the `mainnet_base` section, unless
overridden.

 * `protocolMagic` -- this number is different from mainnet's magic to
   ensure that the address format of testnet is different to mainnet.
 * `totalBalance` -- 200,000,000,000 Ada -- is a third of mainnet's
   total balance.
 * `richmenShare` -- 99% -- same as mainnet. This means that
   2,000,000,000 Ada will be "in circulation".
 * `avvmDistr` -- this is the empty hashmap, unlike in mainnet which
   has many Ada redemption addresses.
 * `fakeAvvmBalances` -- there are 100 fake AVVM seeds which can be
   used to redeem 10,000,000 Ada each on the testnet.
 * `poors` -- Unlike mainnet, there are 100 "poor" nodes with
   generated keys. Each of these will have 10,000,000 testnet Ada
   which can be spent.
 * `richmen` -- There are 7 testnet richmen, i.e. core nodes, same as
   mainnet.
 
## Faucet

The testnet faucet will dispense a random amount in the range of 500
to 1500 Ada.

It is not currently rate limited.

According to the parameters above, up to 2,000,000,000 Ada could be
dispensed, though not all should be made available to the faucet.

## Maintaining control of testnet Ada

IOHK will retain control of the majority of testnet Ada to minimise
the risk of the testnet becoming a threat blockchain and the testnet
currency assuming value.

The core nodes (richmen) control 99% of stake.

Additionally, not all AVVM certificates and "poor" addresses should be
sent to the faucet.

## Redeeming ADA from fake AVVM seeds

The certificate seeds are in the `keys-fakeavvm` directory within the
output of `cardano-keygen generate-keys-by-spec`.

Copy one of `fake-N.seed` to the clipboard, then use the Daedalus
wallet UI to redeem the testnet Ada.

1. Click on the _Daedalus_ â†’ _Ada redemption_ menu
2. Go to the _Regular_ tab
3. Paste the seed into the _Redemption key_ box.

## Importing "poor" secret keys into a wallet

Copy one of `generated-keys/poor/keyN.sk` to a secure location and
then use the v0 `/api/wallets/keys` endpoint to import it into a
wallet.

## Launching a demo cluster with testnet genesis

This script will generate genesis data using the procedure described
in [`configuration.md`](../configuration.md), and then launch a demo
cluster with that genesis data.

    nix-build -A demoClusterLaunchGenesis -o demo-cluster-launch-genesis.sh
    ./demo-cluster-launch-genesis.sh
    
## Connecting to the testnet

This script will connect to the running public testnet.

     nix-build -A connectScripts.testnet.wallet -o connect-testnet-wallet.sh
    ./connect-testnet-wallet.sh
