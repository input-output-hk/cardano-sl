-- | DNS domains for relay discovery
--
-- We provide a list of list of domain names to query. The outer list
-- corresponds to backup DNS servers; the inner lists provide multiple
-- domain names which serve different purposes (e.g., the first might be
-- configured to return geolocated hosts, with the second a load-balancing
-- fall-back). The idea is that querying each of the elements of the inner
-- lists provides a complete set of relay nodes to be tried, using the
-- backup domain names only when one or more of the primary ones fail.

-- error that occurred for all alternatives (we don't continue trying a set of
-- domains after the first error).
