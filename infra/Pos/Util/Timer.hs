-- | Restartable, STM-based timer for waiting a given number of microseconds.
--
-- Consider the following code:
-- @
--   main :: IO ()
--   main = do
--     delay <- newTimer $ 5 * 1000000
--     tid <- forkIO . forever $ do
--       startTimer delay
--       atomically $ waitTimer delay
--       putStrLn $ "Timer ended"
--     (`finally` killThread tid) . forever $ do
--       _ <- getLine
--       startTimer delay
-- @
--
-- It will print "Timer ended" every 5 seconds after there was no input for 5
-- seconds.
