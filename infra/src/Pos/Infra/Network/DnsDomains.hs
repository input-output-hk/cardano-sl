-- | DNS domains for relay discovery
--
-- We provide a list of list of domain names to query.
-- Just like for static routes, it's a conjunction of disjuctions:
-- try to use one alternative from each list. This implicitly encodes
-- valency and fallbacks.
-- The idea is that resolving at least one name from each of the inner lists
-- provides a complete set of relay nodes to be tried, using the
-- backup domain names (further back in the inner lists) only when one or more
-- of the primary ones (further forward in the inner lists) fail.
