-- | First iteration solution to the inv/req/data/mempool system.
-- Diffusion layer will set up the relays, but it needs help from the logic
-- layer in order to figure out what to request after an inv, what to relay
-- (the Bool return values), and of course what to actually do with the data,
-- which is tied up with whether it should be relayed (processing the data
-- and returning a Bool to indicate whether to relay).
--
--   - Does 'toKey' need to be monadic? Surely the datum itself contains the
--     key and this can be a pure function 'val -> key'. Maybe not? Must look
--     into it.
--   - How much help from the logic layer does the diffusion layer really need
--     in order to determine whether to relay something?
--     How much of the inv/req/data system can be done entirely by the
--     diffusion layer? Perhaps it should keep a little cache of keys it has
--     seen, ignore keys which are in that cache, and for keys which are not,
--     enqueue them up to the logic layer.
--     For handling 'Req' messages, though, logic layer support will in fact
--     be necessary I think; can't expect the diffusion layer to take care of
--     storing everything.
--
--   - Must investigate the mempool aspect.
--     Only transactions use this.
--     The MempoolParams KeyMempool constructor includes an m [key] which I
--     guess produces all keys in the mempool. Ah yes, this is so that a peer
--     can request everything in the mempool.
--     See 'handleMempoolL'. The entire mempool (as keys) is dumped to a list,
--     and then each key is 'Inv'd once (InvMsg sent).
--
--     I do not believe we ever make a mempool request (MempoolMsg).
--     Ok we can probably dump this.
