-- | @currentSystemTag@ is a value obtained at compile time with TemplateHaskell
-- that represents that current system's platform (i.e. where it was compiled).
-- As of the @cardano-sl-1.0.4@, the only officially supported systems are @win64@ and
-- @macos64@ (@linux64@ can be built and used from source).
-- If @currentSystemTag@ is not one of these two when this test is ran with
-- @cardano-sl-1.0.4@, something has gone wrong.
