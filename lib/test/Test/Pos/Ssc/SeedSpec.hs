-- | When each party has provided either an opening or shares (or both), we
-- should be able to recover the secret. When at least somebody hasn't
-- provided an opening or a secret, we should fail.
--
-- Specifically, we simulate the following scenario:
--
-- * Everybody has sent a commitment and generated a seed.
-- * 'n_openings' nodes have sent openings to the blockchain.
-- * 'n_shares' nodes have sent their shares to other nodes.
-- * /Among those,/ 'n_overlap' nodes have sent both.
-- * All nodes have sent -shares they have received- to the blockchain.
--   'n' shares are required to recover a secret.
