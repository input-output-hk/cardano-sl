{- A note on the following tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reason these tests have to pass a custom generator for the prefix of the action list
to '(==^)' is that in each case, there is a particular sequence of actions for which
the property does not hold. Using one of the following tests as an example:

Let 'o, o´ :: Opening' such that 'o /= o´'. This sequence of actions
in the 'PureToss' monad:

    [PutOpening sid o´, PutOpening sid o, DelOpening sid]

is not, in operational semantics terms, equal to the sequence

    [PutOpening sid o´]

It is instead equivalent to

    []

Because these actions are performed from left to right, performing an insertion with the
same key several times without deleting it in between those insertions means only the
last insertion actually matters for these tests.

As such, prefixes with an insertion with the same key as the action being tested in the
property will cause it to fail.
