    Get the transitive changeset.

    To scare the reader, we suggest the example. Imagine the following
    transformation (all arrows are oriented to the right). First graph
    G is one we store in DB. We apply the list of edgeActions {del DE,
    add CF} ~ F to it. Note that order of applying edgeActions
    matters, so we can't go incrementally building graph G' = G ∪ F
    from G.

    A   F--G      A   F--G
     \             \ /
      C--D--E  ⇒    C  D  E
     /             /
    B             B

    Let dlg_H(a) denote the transitive delegation relation, returning
    Nothing or Just dPk. Then we want to:
    1. Find affected users af = {uv ∈ E(G) ∪ E(F) | dlg_G(u) ≠ dlg_G'(u)}
    2. Calculate new delegate set dlgnew = {(a,dlg_G'(a)), a ∈ af}
    3. Zip dlgnew with old delegates (queried from DB).


    Step 1. Lemma. Let's call x-points XP the set issuers of
    edgeActions set from F. Then af is equal to union of all subtrees
    with root x ∈ XP called U, calculated in graph G'.

    Proof.
    1. a ∈ af ⇒ a ∈ U. Delegate of a changed.
       * (Nothing → Just d) conversion, then we've added some av edge,
         v = d ∨ dlg(v) = d, then a ∈ U.
       * (Just d → Nothing) conversion, we removed direct edge av,
         v = d ∨ dlg(v) = d, same.
       * (Just d₁ → Just d₂), some edge e on path a →→ d₁ was switched
         to another branch or deleted.
    2. a ∈ U ⇒ a ∈ af
       Just come up the tree to the first x ∈ XP.
       * x = a, then we've just either changed or got new/removed
         old delegate.
       * x ≠ a, same.

    So on step 1 it's sufficient to find U. See the code to understand
    how it's done using existent dlgTransRev mapping.


    Step 2. Let's use memoized tree traversal to compute dlgnew. For
    every a ∈ af we'll come to the top of the tree until we see any
    marked value or reach the end.

    1. We've stuck to the end vertex d, which is delegate. Mark dlg(d)
    = Nothing,

    2. We're on u, next vertex is v, we know dlg(v). Set dlg(u) =
    dlg(v) and apply it to all the traversal chain before. If dlg(v) =
    Nothing, set dlg(u) = v instead.


    Step 3 is trivial.
