-- | Choose several random stakeholders (specifically, their amount is
-- currently hardcoded in 'Pos.Constants.epochSlots').
--
-- The probability that a stakeholder will be chosen is proportional to the
-- number of coins this stakeholder holds. The same stakeholder can be picked
-- more than once.
--
-- How the algorithm works: we sort all unspent outputs in a deterministic
-- way (lexicographically) and have an ordered sequence of pairs
-- @(StakeholderId, Coin)@. Then we choose several random 'i's between 1 and
-- amount of satoshi in the system; to find owner of 'i'th coin we find the
-- lowest x such that sum of all coins in this list up to 'i'th is not less
-- than 'i' (and then 'x'th address is the owner).
--
-- With P2SH addresses, we don't know who is going to end up with funds sent
-- to them. Therefore, P2SH addresses can contain 'addrDestination' which
-- specifies which addresses should count as “owning” funds for the purposes
-- of follow-the-satoshi.
