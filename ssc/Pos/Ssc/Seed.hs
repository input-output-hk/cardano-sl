-- | Calculate SharedSeed. SharedSeed is a random bytestring that all
-- nodes generate together and agree on.
--
-- A story of why we pass nodes' VSS keys here: SCRAPE needs to know the
-- order of shares (i.e. you can't give it shares 4, 1 and 3, you must
-- necessarily give it 1,3,4). It also can't deduce the order of shares
-- because the shares don't carry any IDs or anything. Thus we need to
-- impose some arbitrary order on them. I chose to order the shares by
-- stakeholder's VSS key, which means that we need to know stakeholders' VSS
-- keys in addition to a `Stakeholder->[Share]` map if we want to recover
-- the secret.
