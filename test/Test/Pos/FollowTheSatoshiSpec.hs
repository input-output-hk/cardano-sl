-- current state.

-- Two necessarily different addrhashes are generated, as well as a list of
-- addrhashes who will be our other stakeholders. To guarantee a non-empty
-- utxo map, one of these addrhashes is inserted in the list, which is
-- converted to a set and then to a map, where each addrhash is given as key
-- a random pair (TxId, Coin).

-- | This test is a sanity check to verify that 'followTheSatoshi' does not
-- behave too extremely, i.e. someone with 2% of stake won't be chosen a
-- disproportionate number of times, and someone with 98% of it will be
-- chosen almost every time.
--
-- For an infinite list of Utxo maps and an infinite list of 'SharedSeed's, the
-- 'followTheSatoshi' function will be ran many times with a different seed and
-- map each time and the absolute frequency of the choice of a given address
-- as stakeholder will be compared to a low/high threshold, depending on whether
-- the address has a low/high stake, respectively.
-- For a low/high stake, the test succeeds if this comparison is below/above the
-- threshold, respectively.
