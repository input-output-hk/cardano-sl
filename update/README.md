# cardano-sl-update

This package contains the code which implements the mechanisms by which the
Cardano SL network proposes software and protocol upgrades, votes on whether
these upgrades should go ahead and applies them when voting has decided in
favour of a proposal. Users of the network vote on proposals weighted by the
amount of stake they hold and these voting rights can be delegated to other
stakeholders.
