-- | By default, fees are separate from a posted payment. When you submit
-- a 'Payment' to the API, you are saying "Please send Alice 5 ADA, and the fees
-- will come out of my balance." The @feesIncluded@ parameter allows us to
-- include those fees in the payment, allowing us to express "Please send Bob
-- 3 ADA, and fees will come out of the ADA I am sending."
--
-- When fees are "included" in the payment amount, this means that we need to
-- somehow subtract the fee amount computed for the 'Transaction' from the
-- outputs in the 'Payment''s 'PaymentDistribution's. For the trivial case (a
-- single payment), this is easy -- we deduct the entire fee amount from the
-- transaction.
--
-- For payments with multiple outputs, we must consider carefully how to address
-- the fee. There are a number of possible ways to distribute the fee among
-- several 'PaymentDistribution's:
--
-- 1. Allow the user to specify the precise amount to deduct from each payment.
--    This would provide a somewhat complicated API for questionable gain.
-- 2. Deduct a proportion of the fee evenly from each payment. In pseudocode,
--    this is:
--
--    @
--    newOutputs fee outputs =
--        map (subtract (fee `div` length outputs)) outputs
--    @
--
--    This runs the risk of draining a 'PaymentDistribution's output to @0@,
--    which would likely be an error case (there's no reason to ever have an
--    output of @0@, unless you just really like paying fees for some reason).
--    For this reason, this mode is unsupported.
-- 3. Deduct an amount proportional to each payment. In pseudocode, this is:
--
--    @
--    newOutputs fee outputs =
--        let
--            total =
--                sum outputs
--            subtractProportion output =
--                output - (fee * (output / total))
--        in
--            map subtractProportion outputs
--    @
--
--    This makes the likelihood of zeroing out a payment much less likely -- the
--    only way we can observe that now is in the strange case of tiny payments
--    where rounding causes it to zero out. We must still account for this, but
--    it is less likely.
--
-- The astute observer will note that we operate on 'Coin', a wrapper around
-- 'Word64' representing the number of Lovelace coins, but the operations
-- require rational numbers. This implies the potential for rounding issues.
-- Rounding issues give us three options: 'round', 'floor', and 'ceiling'.
--
-- Let's consider the strategies with the following data:
--
-- >>> outputs = [5, 8, 10]
-- >>> total = sum outputs
-- >>> fee = 3
-- >>> withProportions xs = map (\x -> (x, fromIntegral x / fromIntegral (sum xs)))
-- >>> withProportions outputs
-- [(5,0.21739130434782608),(8,0.34782608695652173),(10,0.43478260869565216)]
-- >>> subtractProportion output = fromIntegral output - (fee * (output / total))
-- >>> let precise = map (\o -> fromIntegral o - (fee * (o / total))) outputs
-- >>> precise
-- [4.875,7.8,9.75]
--
-- Our initial total spending was 23, and we want to deduct a fee of 3 from this
-- amount, for a total disbursement of 20 to these outputs. Let's observe the
-- result of the different options:
--
-- >>> sum (map round precise)
-- 23
--
-- Well, 'round' appears to be precisely what we want! The total lines up
-- exactly. Is this by chance? We can write a QuickCheck property to test it.

-- | This function implements the fee distribution logic described in the

-- this function returns 'Nothing' if either are violated:
--
-- 1. The fee amount must be less than the total of the outputs. If this is
--    violated, then it would be impossible for the fee to come entirely from
--    the outputs, so the transaction is invalid.
-- 2. None of the outputs may be 0.
