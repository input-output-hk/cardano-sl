         --    is already claimed, but if this happens we simply try again.
         -- 2. Perform the actual creation of the 'HdAddress' as an atomic
         --    transaction in acid-state.
         --
         -- The reason why we do this is because:
         -- 1. We cannot do IO (thus index derivation) in an acid-state
         --    transaction
         -- 2. In order to create an 'HdAddress' we need a proper 'Address',
         -- but this cannot be derived with having access to the
         -- 'EncryptedSecretKey' and the 'PassPhrase', and we do not want
         -- these exposed in the acid-state transaction log.

-- | Creates a new 'Address' using the random HD derivation under the hood.
-- Being this an operation bound not only by the number of available derivation
-- indexes \"left\" in the account, some form of short-circuiting is necessary.
-- Currently, the algorithm is as follows:
--
-- 1. Try to generate an 'Address' by picking a random index;
-- 2. If the operation succeeds, return the 'Address';
-- 3. If the DB operation fails due to a collision, try again, up to a max of
--    1024 attempts.
-- 4. If after 1024 attempts there is still no result, flag this upstream.
