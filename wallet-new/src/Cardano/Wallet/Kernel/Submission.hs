-- Internal combinators used to limit the number of retries of a 'RetryPolicy'
-- to an upper bound of 'MaxRetries' attempts.
-- We don't want to throw an error in case we end up a case where
-- getSubmissionCount submissionCount > maxRetries, because different
-- ResubmissionFunctions can be configured with different 'RetryPolicy'es, and
-- those can have a more stringent limit on a policy applied at until a given
-- moment, so it's still possible to have elements in the schedule with a
-- 'SubmissionCount' larger than the 'MaxRetries', and calling the 'retryPolicy'
-- would cause an error. Having a lenient @otherwise@ case solves this.
