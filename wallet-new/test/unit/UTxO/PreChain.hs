-- | A chain with "holes" for the bootstrap transaction and the fees
--
-- We use the 'DepIndep' monad transformer here to make sure that the
-- effects can depend on the bootstrap transaction, but not on the fees.
-- This is important. Suppose we used
--
-- > Transaction h Addr -> [[Fee]] -> m (Blocks h Addr)
--
-- instead: we'd have to execute the action that generates the blocks
-- /twice/ (once before we know the fees, and once again after we computed
-- the fees), and the second time around we may in fact generate a very
-- different chain (think @m@ = QuickCheck 'Gen', for instance) -- which
-- would then require very different fees. No good. If we did
--
-- > m (Transaction h Addr -> [[Fee]] -> Blocks h Addr)
--
-- instead, then (thinking @m@ = 'Gen' again) we could not generate different
-- chains for different bootstrap transactions, which would also be no good.
--
-- It is still the responsibility of the 'PreChain' author to make sure that the
-- structure of the blockchain does not depend on the fees that are passed.

  Fee calculation

type Fee = Value

-- | Calculate fees for a bunch of transactions
--
-- Transaction fee calculation is a bit awkward.
--
-- First, when we want to construct a number of transactions, then it may not be
-- sufficient to only know the fee for each transaction locally. For example, if
-- we want to transfer X from A to B, and then the remainder of A's balance to
-- C, we need to transactions with outputs
--
-- >  [ X from A to B, balanceA - X - fee1 from A back to A ]
-- >  [ balanceA - X - fee1 - fee2 from A to C ]
--
-- where we need to know the fee of the first transaction in order to create
-- the second.
--
-- Second, in order to be able to even know what the fee of a transaction is,
-- we need to /construct/ the transaction since the fee depends on the
-- transaction size.
--
-- So, what we do is we first construct all transactions assuming the fee is 0.
-- We then calculate the fees, and finally construct the transactions again
-- with their proper fees.
--
-- The function constructing the transactions from the fees must satisfy
-- two conditions:
--
-- * The transactions returned cannot depend on the fees! Basically, the
--   transactions should regard these fees as uninspectable. If this condition
--   is not met the fees calculated will be incorrect. (Possibly we might
--   be able to address this at the type level with some PHOAS like
--   representation.)
--
-- * The function can assume that the list fees it is given contains a fee
--   for each transaction, in order, but it the list may be longer. The reason
--   is that initially we cannot even know how many transactions the function
--   returns, and hence we just provide an infinite list of zeroes.
--   (We could address this at the type level by using vectors.)
--
-- TODO: We should check that the fees of the constructed transactions match the
-- fees we calculuated. This ought to be true at the moment, but may break when
-- the size of the fee might change the size of the the transaction.
