-- | Required information about block where given pending transaction is sited
type PtxBlockInfo = ChainDifficulty

-- | Information which is stored in pending tx pool when correspondent
-- transaction is not in blockchain
type PtxPoolInfo = TxHistoryEntry

-- | Current state of pending transaction.
--
-- Once transaction creation is initiated, it should be assigned 'PtxCreating'
-- condition. It indicates that transaction may still fail on creation stage,
-- in such case the pending transaction should be removed.
--
-- Once transaction is created, it should be assigned 'PtxApplying' condition
-- in order to be tracked by resubmitter.
--
-- When wallet tracker notices a block with given transaction, it switches
-- condition to 'PtxInNewestBlocks' providing needed information about that
-- block. Transactions in this state are periodically tried to be submitted
-- again by special wallet worker.
-- Full transaction creation cycle may complete later than block with the
-- transaction gets delivered. In this case, status jumps from 'PtxCreating'
-- to 'PtxInNewestBlocks', missing 'PtxApplying' stage.
--
-- Resubmitter also checks whether transaction is deep enough in blockchain to
-- be moved to 'PtxPersisted' state.
-- Transactions which are marked as persistent can lose their status if block
-- which contains this transactions gets rollbacked. However, if at some moment
-- transaction becomes just "not deep enough" due to rollbacks, it doesn't cause
-- the transaction to become 'PtxInNewestBlocks' again, because such small
-- "tides" of chain difficulty likely occur and we do not want to confuse users
-- switching status back and forth.
--
-- If transaction is ever noticed to be impossible to apply to current utxo,
-- it is assigned 'PtxWontApply' state and is stopped being tracked further
-- (effect can be canceled by BListener on rollback though).
-- This behaviour is to be improved in CSM-390.
